Our prototype conveys creepiness through a multisensory experience. Lured in by the present's attractive exterior, the presentee quickly learns about the present's real nature when they try to open it. The wooden sticks scratch along the surface of a sand paper, creating a sound similar to scratching a nail across a blackboard. Once opened, the various used items create an eery atmosphere similar to a place that hasn't been properly taken care of in a while.
