Alex is on his way to the main railway station to travel to his parents. They live on the countryside, about 3 hours outside of town. 
As he is approaching the platform, the train is already there. The queueing is always time-consuming and a bit boring, since they switched to the new "Safe Travels" process. Appareantly there was too much criminality happening in public transport or whatever, that was why the switched to the new system. Alex does not really care. He patiently waits for his turn, as only one person at a time can enter the train. 
When he was next in line, he deeply looked into the camera to get his retina scanned and be authorized to enter. Once this check was done, he could scan his ticket near the entry door. 
The system guides him to his reserved seat. On his way there, he is passing all the passengers, who have boarded the train at earlier stops. They are sleeping, as this is the main part of the "Safe Travels" concept. 
The seat sends frequencies to ones brain in order to „switch it off“, at least this is what Alex understood. 
„Weird, they all don‘t really look as if they were asleep“, Alex thinks. Of course the eyelids are closed and the people are not moving, but their bodied look unnormally tense. To Alex this state appears like it's a weird space between awake and uncounciousness, unreal, like a sleep paralysis. Nevertheless, he sits down.

3h later Alex awakes, still in the same position he fell asleep. He is confused. He can't really remeber how he got here.
But this is normal. The moments before your brain is put to sleep by the soundwaves are always a bit „blurry“. 
He sees that the train arrives at his destination in 3 minutes, barely enough time to put on his backpack and take out his luggage from under the seat. He can't really say if he dreamt anything, in fact he could not even tell if he was sleeping at all. His body feels exhausted and tired, his brain empty. His motorics are still not at a 100% accuracy when he is leaving the train as it arrives at the station.
