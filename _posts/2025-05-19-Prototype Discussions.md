In the final exhibition we try to recreate the creepy experience that potential travellers would have after using our product.
Therefore we want to build a comfortable chair back that can be placed on top of another chair. This chair back should comfortable (we see what we can do tbh) and inviting to achieve the maximum level of contrast once the creepyness begins.
Some speakers will be hidden in the ears of our chair back. Once a person sits down, our uncomfortable sound will be played and a few seconds later it will get dark. This is done via a blanket that is stored behind the head of the participant and will be put/thrown over the sitting person (very gently). We thought about this for a very long time and it seems like the best option, compared to the rest. Also we want to print our large pictures to create the illusion of being in an actual train. Here you can see a sketch:
