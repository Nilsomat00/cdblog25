This episode is inspired by discussions about artists, writers and other creatives not being compensated for their work, which has, in many instances without their consent or even knowledge about it, been used to train AI models. In my scenario, material that is considered useful for AI models to digest has been processed. At this point, the AI models are at risk of only feeding off of their own output, which would drastically worsen the models' qualities. Culture and the arts are now dominated by AI content, and human creativity is considered too expensive. For creative workers, the only reliable source of income is to sell their original material to AI companies in a state during which their brain is most creative: In their sleep.
